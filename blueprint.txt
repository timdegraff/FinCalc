PROJECT OVERVIEW: FINCALC CO-PILOT
================================================================================
FinCalc is a high-fidelity financial architecture tool designed for precision 
planning, specifically optimized for the 2026 Michigan tax/benefit landscape. 
It differs from generic calculators by focusing on MAGI (Modified Adjusted Gross 
Income) manipulation to maximize state benefits like Medicaid and SNAP while 
simulating complex retirement bridges (72t/SEPP).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CORE PHILOSOPHY & UI PREFERENCES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  AESTHETICS: High-contrast "Dark Mode" (Slate-900/800). All numbers MUST use 
    'JetBrains Mono'. Labels use 'Inter' font with heavy tracking-tighter.
2.  COLOR LOGIC (STRICT ADHERENCE):
    - Teal (#14b8a6): Growth, Assets, Net Worth, HSA.
    - Pink (#ec4899): Expenses, Liabilities, Debts.
    - Magenta (#f472b6): Cash.
    - Amber (#f59e0b): Crypto (Bitcoin).
    - Yellow (#eab308): Metals (Gold).
    - Blue (#3b82f6): Pre-Tax / 401k / Strategy.
    - Purple (#a855f7): Post-Tax / Roth.
    - Indigo (#6366f1): Real Estate.
    - Rose (#fb7185): 529 Plan.
3.  REAL-TIME: Every slider and input must trigger an immediate re-calculation. 
    Persistence is handled via debounced Firebase saves on BOTH 'input' and 'change' events.
4.  ACCURACY: Tax brackets and benefit thresholds (FPL) are modeled on 2026 
    projections for Michigan.
5.  PRECISION: MAGI calculation is king. The system must accurately distinguish 
    between taxable and non-taxable income for benefit optimization.
6.  BENEFIT OPTIMIZATION: The burndown engine supports specific strategies:
    - Medicaid Max (138% FPL Target)
    - Silver Max (250% FPL Target)
    - Real Value Preservation (Portfolio stays flat in inflation-adjusted terms)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILE ARCHITECTURE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- index.html: The shell. Uses a sidebar-main layout with tab-based navigation.
- index.css: Global styles, custom scrollbars, and Tailwind overrides.
- main.js: The entry point. Initializes modules and handles Firebase Auth state.
- core.js: UI Orchestrator. Manages listeners, tab switching, and assumptions.
- data.js: The "Brain". Handles UI scraping, Firebase persistence, and summary updates.
- utils.js: The "Engine". Contains all math for taxes, SEPP, SNAP, and asset colors.
- templates.js: Visual building blocks. Contains the HTML generators for dynamic rows.
- formatter.js: Standardizes currency and numeric input behaviors.
- benefits.js: Specialized logic for Medicaid/HMP and SNAP eligibility.
- projection.js: Long-term forecasting logic. Renders the Stacked Area chart and Data Table.
- burndown.js: Retirement simulator. Handles draggable priority and withdrawal logic.
- auth.js: Google OAuth bridge.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEY FEATURE LOGIC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  STRATEGY ENGINE (Burndown):
    - Prioritizes "Persistent Income" (SS, Pensions) first.
    - Calculates SNAP benefits as a budget supplement based on resulting MAGI.
    - Supports 72(t) SEPP distributions for pre-59.5 bridge funding.
    - Draggable Draw Priority: Allows users to reorder which accounts get tapped.
    - 3 Core Strategies: 138% FPL Max, 250% FPL Max, and Wealth Preservation.
    
2.  BENEFITS MODULE:
    - Michigan 2026 Specific: No asset tests for SNAP/HMP. 
    - Real-time FPL (Federal Poverty Level) ratio tracking.
    - Automated Health Tier assignment (Medicaid vs HMP vs Silver Marketplace).

3.  PROJECTION:
    - Models growth based on separate asset class percentages (Stocks vs Crypto vs Real Estate).
    - Includes an "End Age" slider to cap the visualization.
    - Toggleable "Real Dollars" mode to visualize value adjusted for inflation.
    - Granular Data Table: Every 5-year snapshot of account balances.

4.  INVESTMENT EFFICIENCY:
    - Calculates a real-time "Efficiency %" badge for every account.
    - Logic: 100% for Roth/529. Tax-adjusted for 401k. Gains-adjusted for Taxable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DATA PERSISTENCE (FIREBASE)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Structure: /users/{uid}/
- All tables are scraped into JSON arrays.
- Scraper covers: inputs, selects, checkboxes, and toggle-buttons (frequency).
- Persistence must be triggered by 'change' events on dropdowns and 'input' on text fields.
